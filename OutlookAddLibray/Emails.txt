SUBJECT: 15-Minute Demo;
When you have a minute, Microsoft Office for Legal was hoping you
could suggest a good time to set up a 15 - minute phone call and demo with
you or one of the people in your firm that is responsible for docketing litigation
deadlines. Microsoft recently introduced me to LawToolBox365, a matter - based deadline
management system inside Outlook(case studies, brochure).LawToolBox, who has been automating
court rules calendaring for state and federal courts around the country since the late 90s is
offering LawToolBox365 as a bundle with Office 365 for a monthly per user fee.If you have a minute
please check out this 2 - min video.If you are interested, can you suggest a good person in your firm
to schedule a 15 - minute phone call and demo this week ? Or next week ? We look forward
to getting your feedback on how or if you think this Office 365 deadline management system
will save time generating deadlines, getting them into Outlook, tracking rule changes, and
supporting malpractice insurance requirements for multiple reminder systems.Thank you
